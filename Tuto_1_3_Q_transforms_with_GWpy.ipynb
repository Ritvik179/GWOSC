        "- [`spectrogram()`](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/api/gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.html#gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.spectrogram) - which includses a `stride` parameter, and shows an averaged ASD every time interval corresponding to each stride, and\n",

These FFTs can include overlapping segments of tdata, as specified by the `overlap` parameter.\n",

        "The long answer is that averaging the FFTs computed each stride of data reduces the variance of the resulting ASD estimate. However, these averages also reduce the time resolution of the corresponding spectrogram, which is no more `fftlength` $-$ `overlap` but is now determined by the duration of the `stride`. This is called [Welch's spectral density estimation method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_method).\n",

After multiplying by the window, the data directly surrounding the glitch will be zeroed. It is also important that the window function includes a transition from 0 to 1 so that there are not any discontinuities introduced. An example of a window function can be seen in the lower panel of Fig. 2 from [the GW170817 discovery paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101).\n",
